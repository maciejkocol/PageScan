# Automated page scan in Java with Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver #

This project browses a selection of pages and validates the following:
- There are no console errors on page loads
- The response code from the page (200, 302, 404, etc.)
- All links on the page go to another live (non 4xx) page

Test scenarios are defined in the feature files at ./src/test/resources/com/automatedtest/scan.
